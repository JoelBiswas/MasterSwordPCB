# MasterSwordPCB
PCB created for Hack Club Solder

Slack Username: Joel Biswas

The PCB is in the shape of a master sword. The button acts as a toggle on/off switch. When the system is on, the potentiometer controls the vibration strength of a motor near the top of the sword. The circuit uses a transistor-based latch design to allow the button to act as a toggle.
